# Moso

**Moso** is a minimal macOS menu bar app written in Swift, based on the awesome
[Pomodoro] project. Other pomodoro apps do too much, don't look good,
or have ads. Moso does exactly what it needs to do, and doesn't have ads.

Moso runs the classic Pomodoro schedule: 25-minute tasks with 5-minute breaks.
When a task or a break is over, it sends a notification.

The name [Moso] derived from Taiwanese Hakka <ruby>摸<rt>mò</rt>挲<rt>sò</rt></ruby>,
which means fiddling around out of procrastination.
